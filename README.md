# Face_recognition_attendance_system


## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

The Face Recognition Attendance System is a smart solution designed to automate attendance marking using facial recognition technology. Instead of manual sign-ins, users' faces are scanned and attendance is marked automatically, ensuring faster, more accurate, and contactless attendance management.

This project combines the power of Python, OpenCV, and face_recognition libraries to detect, recognize, and record attendance efficiently.

- Real-time face detection & recognition

- Auto attendance with timestamp

- Attendance records saved in a CSV file


## âš™ Tech Stack

- Python 3
